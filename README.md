# COVID-19 Twitter tracker

> The goal is to track and get latest updates on COVID-19

The end goal seems to have a dynamic cli display with latest tweets popping up and the most retweeted tweet in the last 1 hour show up as a highlight.

## TODO:
1. Mark tweets with geo-location (Hopefully pin em on a map after that)
2. Make the grab logic asynchronous
3. Get highest retweeted tweet of the day, week, hour
4. Have a dynamic view of the data in a static shell instance
